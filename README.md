## Why Lazier?

A change should stay proportional to the problem it solves.

Lazier is a portable engineering policy for **Codex Local** and **ChatGPT Web**.
It guides agents to understand the existing system, make a focused change, and
verify the behavior that matters.

- **Keep it simple.** Reuse existing tools and patterns. Add machinery when a
  current requirement justifies its cost.
- **Keep it correct.** Preserve contracts, failure handling, security boundaries,
  and recovery behavior. Necessary safeguards stay.
- **Keep it grounded.** Base decisions and review findings on source evidence.
  Run relevant checks and state what remains unverified.

The package is instructions: one Skill, two host adapters, a pinned C2C Web snapshot, and a
[shared policy](skills/codex-lazier/references/policy.md). No daemon, custom hook,
or runtime dependency. Simplicity reviews run only when you ask.

## Quick start

### 1. Get the package

Download the ZIP and its matching `.sha256` file from
**[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hudrucan/codex-lazier/releases)**.
Put the two files from the same release in an otherwise empty directory:

```sh
sha256sum --check codex-lazier-*.sha256
```

On macOS, use `shasum -a 256 -c codex-lazier-*.sha256`. No release available yet?
[Build from source](#development).

### 2. Choose your host

#### Codex Local

Use one [host-supported discovery location](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills)
for each Skill; the user scope shown here is `~/.agents/skills`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
unzip codex-lazier-*.zip -d ~/.agents/skills
```

For an explicit update, replace the complete Skill directory at the installation
you selected, after verifying the new archive. Inspect existing discovery roots
first; do not install another copy under `~/.codex/skills` or a repository root.
A legacy/custom location may remain when supported by that host: update it in
place and keep any bootstrap bound to its actual path. Do not delete or migrate
legacy copies automatically.

Then start a new session and use `$codex-lazier` in your request.

<details>
<summary><strong>Apply Lazier automatically to coding tasks</strong></summary>

Add an instruction to your repository's `AGENTS.md`, or your Codex home's
`AGENTS.md` (normally `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`), to read and apply the installed
Skill's `references/codex.md` once per chat for every coding task. Use its actual
absolute installed path. That reference loads `references/policy.md` itself;
no manual Skill invocation is needed for this bootstrap.
Preserve existing guidance and check for an active `AGENTS.override.md`.

Start a new session and ask Codex to summarize its loaded instructions.
Installing the Skill alone does not activate persistent instructions.
The [Codex reference](skills/codex-lazier/references/codex.md) owns C2C handoffs
and Context Mode preferences. For a legacy installation that copied Lazier into
`AGENTS.md`, replace only that Lazier block with the bootstrap above. Keep the
installed references together; do not maintain another policy copy.

</details>

#### ChatGPT Web

1. Where Skill uploads are supported, install the release ZIP as a ChatGPT Skill.
2. Start a new conversation and check that `codex-lazier` is available. The Skill
   loads its Web reference for coding and automatic C2C handoff audits.
3. Keep MCP connector, Hub and workspace routing in **Project Instructions**.
   Lazier behavior comes from the installed Skill.

For hosts without Skill support, make the complete extracted reference tree
available offline (including `references/c2c/`), and optionally select the existing
[policy](skills/codex-lazier/references/policy.md) and
[Web reference](skills/codex-lazier/references/web.md) available as Project sources
and instruct the Project to apply them with their task-specific references. Disclose if the
host cannot read them. Preserve existing Project guidance; no Lazier copy in
Project Instructions is needed. Installing the Skill neither connects a repository
nor grants access.

## In practice

### Implement a change

```text
Use $codex-lazier to add pagination to this endpoint.
Follow the existing API conventions and test the relevant behavior.
```

The agent traces the current flow, chooses a focused implementation, and
reports the checks it actually ran. No automatic simplicity-review cycle.

### Ask for a simplicity review

```text
Review this diff for unnecessary complexity.
Report supported simplifications; do not edit.
```

Findings need evidence and a smaller alternative that preserves required
behavior. Justified code can stay unchanged.

### Delegate through C2C

```text
[C2C Task]
Repo: <repository>; workspace: <registered workspace ID>.
Add pagination using the existing API conventions.
Run focused validation. Do not commit or push.
```

With C2C configured, Web plans and audits while Codex implements and tests
against local source. `[C2C Plan]` only plans; `[C2C Task]` implements within
scope. Markers and drafted prompts do not execute work or grant permissions.

## Optional integrations

Lazier works on its own. These integrations reuse tools you already have.

- **[Codex with ChatGPT](https://github.com/hudrucan/codex-with-chatgpt)** connects Web planning
  and audits with Codex implementation. It owns repository access and the
  handoff contract. The Web ZIP bundles its pinned canonical files;
  [source pin](tools/c2c-source.json) records the revision and hashes. Codex uses
  the separately installed native C2C contract.
  The [Web reference](skills/codex-lazier/references/web.md) covers automatic
  handoff audits, manual Fix/Commit prompts and opt-in `async=true` callbacks.
  Async requires C2C runtime/OAuth support and an accepted MCP result received by
  the terminal; it does not authorize commits, pushes or rollout.
- **[Context Mode](https://github.com/mksglu/context-mode)** keeps large analysis
  output out of the conversation. The Codex reference prefers installed `ctx_*`
  tools and falls back to bounded native tools when unavailable. Small
  observations and edits can stay direct.
- **[TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/coding-agents)** offers
  a second opinion on substantial C2C decisions with meaningful technical
  trade-offs. Web normally asks once after inspecting constraints and evidence,
  or defers to Codex when fresh local inspection is needed. Reuse the advice;
  skip trivial or settled decisions.

Jev remains advisory. Never automatically forward private source, secrets,
or credentials. Unavailable or abstaining advice does not block the task.

## What to expect

Lazier guides engineering judgment; it does not enforce behavior or guarantee
correctness. User instructions, project requirements, and platform security take
precedence. A successful build or a model probability is not a correctness proof.

Host support determines Skill discovery and invocation. Optional integrations
need their own configuration and permissions; installing Lazier grants neither.
Context Mode installation alone does not prove routing or enforcement.

## Development

Python 3.9+ and its standard library are enough. Supply an explicit local C2C
checkout whose origin, HEAD and allowlisted inputs match [the pin](tools/c2c-source.json).
Builds never fetch or execute C2C code, and never use a different working tree
silently. With that checkout already available, all commands run offline:

```sh
python3 tools/test_package.py --c2c-source /path/to/pinned-c2c
python3 tools/package.py --c2c-source /path/to/pinned-c2c --build
python3 tools/package.py --c2c-source /path/to/pinned-c2c
git diff --check
```

On Windows use `py -3`. ZIP, SHA-256 and provenance sidecar go into ignored
`dist/`; do not commit generated packages. Each ZIP has eleven files: the six
Lazier files (entrypoint, UI metadata, policy, two adapters, LICENSE), three
unmodified C2C workflows under `references/c2c/`, their LICENSE, and
`provenance.json` identifying package version, C2C repository/revision/hashes and
all packaged input hashes. No protocol copies live in Lazier source. Presence
in the ZIP does not mean a reference should be loaded.

Validation checks metadata/version, full local file/anchor closure, source identity,
pinned bytes, symlinks/containment, CRCs, stale content/sidecars and reproducibility.
Tests extract into an independent directory; reading Web guidance needs no source
checkout, network or MCP. Model smoke cases are in [the smoke matrix](tools/smoke-cases.json);
structural assertions do not prove model behavior. A new session using the actually
installed artifact must observe smoke success before calling it daily-ready.
Live MCP/terminal E2E acceptance is a separate result, never implied by packaging.

The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) checks out C2C at the exact pinned
revision with read-only permissions and no persisted credentials. It builds,
checks reproducibility and validates downloaded release assets. Only the tag-only
release job can publish ZIP, checksum and provenance. Tags must match
`v<VERSION>` in `tools/package.py`; update that value and the three guidance
headings together. Updating the C2C snapshot requires a verified full commit,
allowlist hashes and preserved license; never pin uncommitted changes or mutable
`main`/`latest`.

Contributions should stay focused, preserve the Skill contract, and include
checks appropriate to the change.
